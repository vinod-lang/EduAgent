# Development and regression testing

Use the separate Python 3.12 environment; retain the original `venv/` until reviewed.

```sh
python3.12 -m venv .venv-rebuild
.venv-rebuild/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv-rebuild/bin/python -m pytest
```

The suite discovers `tests/`, not the historical `test_setup.py` import checklist.
Tests mock Ollama and vector-store boundaries. Database and Streamlit tests use
pytest temporary directories. Never point test fixtures at existing runtime data.
Offline environment variables prevent accidental model downloads in tests.

Four strict expected failures document unresolved trend-analytics validation:
missing numeric values, nonnumeric values, missing columns, and duplicate names.
They are not passing behavior. Remove each marker when its later-build fix lands.

The current embedding and LLM remain all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and llama3.2:3b. A real
app run opens writable runtime storage; use isolated copies for startup checks.
